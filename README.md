Project Overview

WineInsight is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing wine characteristics to predict ratings and offer tailored recommendations for beginner wine enthusiasts. By cleaning and transforming a large dataset of wine reviews, our team seeks to uncover insights that can simplify wine selection and enhance the tasting experience.

Goals:

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Refine raw data by handling missing values, extracting key features, and categorizing ratings.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize patterns in wine characteristics, ratings, and pricing.

Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning to predict wine ratings based on features like variety, region, and price.

Recommendation System: Build a system to recommend beginner-friendly wines based on preferences.

Dataset

Source: winemag-data-130k-v2.csv

Size: ~130,000 entries

Key Features:

Country, Province, Region

Wine Variety, Winery, Taster Name

Points (Rating), Price

Wine Title (includes year and descriptive details)

Data Cleaning Steps:

Handling Missing Values: Fill or drop null entries for critical features like region and taster names.

Feature Engineering:

Extract vintage year from wine titles.

Categorize points into quality labels (e.g., excellent, good, average).

Classify wines into styles (red, white, ros√©, etc.).

Data Export: Save the cleaned dataset as winemag-data-clean.csv for further analysis.
